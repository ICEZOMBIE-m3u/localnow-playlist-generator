We teamed up with Jared at South and Sabrina Lake, and then we did a day hike back into God's country to Long Lake, which was incredible. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're stopping by Mammoth's one and only Rick's Sports Center to get schooled on some fly fishing on the Owens River, just above Lake Crowley.

Last week, Ryan, Dixie, and I embarked on a six-hour road trip to Bishop, California, with a short 45-minute drive up the mountain to Parcher's Resort. After settling into our comfortable cabin, we kicked off our adventure with some creek fishing. Today on Stoked on Fishing, we're headed to South Lake to fish with Jared, owner and operator of Parcher's Resort and Sierra Slammer Trout Baits. We'll hop on one of his pontoon boats for a three-hour afternoon session.</desc>

With just days until the race - Dale is secretly struggling to get the bike he beat Matt with last year up and working. Matt struggles just to locate a 100-year old bike. Matt&amp;#39;s prayers are answered thanks to an old Catholic Priest he located who has possession of a bike. The priest might let Matt have the bike to race - but there are conditions. The toughest one: Don&amp;#39;t tell Dale you have it. Can Matt afford to buy the bike and get it running in time for the race without Dale seeing it? Will Dale even get his broken bike started? And if they ever get to race, will Matt exact his revenge?</desc>
