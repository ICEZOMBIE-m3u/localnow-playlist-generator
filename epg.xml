No one knows that a gang leader, now in prison, hid the 3 million dollars in cash he stole from his rivals inside the abandoned building. Now, three desperate parties want the money - a blue collared ex-fighter (Adkins) who finds it while working as part of the demolition crew, a prison guard (Lundgren) willing to do anything to pay for his daughter's cancer treatment and a ruthless gang who claim to be the rightful owners. The demolition charges are set, everyone clears out and the Castle is set to fall in 90 minutes. The clock is ticking. Who will find the cash and: will they get out alive?</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Host Philippe Cousteau looks at ways scientists are measuring the health of our forests.  In New England, Philippe visits a white pine forest that is being threatened by invasive plants.  At the University of California - Santa Cruz, students use sonic-tomography to look inside trees in order to detect any signs of disease.  At the Pine Barrens of New Jersey, we discover why the pitch pine tree is able to withstand occasional wildfires.  And in Los Angeles, volunteers are planting trees in order to create an urban forest.</desc>
