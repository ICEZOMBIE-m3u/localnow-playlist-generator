No one knows that a gang leader, now in prison, hid the 3 million dollars in cash he stole from his rivals inside the abandoned building. Now, three desperate parties want the money - a blue collared ex-fighter (Adkins) who finds it while working as part of the demolition crew, a prison guard (Lundgren) willing to do anything to pay for his daughter's cancer treatment and a ruthless gang who claim to be the rightful owners. The demolition charges are set, everyone clears out and the Castle is set to fall in 90 minutes. The clock is ticking. Who will find the cash and: will they get out alive?</desc>

After years of undercover operations involving small time drug dealing, the team pays a call to an illegal pot grower. A seemingly routine call explodes when the grower ambushes and shoots five undercover agents, killing one.

After years of undercover operations involving small time drug dealing, the team pays a call to an illegal pot grower.

Hutchinson exhibits unbelievable acts of bravery to save his fellow officers, and miraculously survives being shot 5 times.

    <desc lang="en">Nate Hutchinson is part of an undercover team in Ogden, UT while working for the Weber County Sheriff's Department. After years of undercover operations involving small time drug dealing, the team pays a call to an illegal pot grower. A seemingly routine call explodes when the grower ambushes and shoots five undercover agents, killing one. Hutchinson exhibits unbelievable acts of bravery to save his fellow officers, and miraculously survives being shot 5 times. He returns to the force and the undercover team, driven to have the last word on the cowardly attacker.</desc>

He returns to the force and the undercover team, driven to have the last word on the cowardly attacker.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nate Hutchinson is part of an undercover team in Ogden, UT while working for the Weber County Sheriff's Department. After years of undercover operations involving small time drug dealing, the team pays a call to an illegal pot grower. A seemingly routine call explodes when the grower ambushes and shoots five undercover agents, killing one. Hutchinson exhibits unbelievable acts of bravery to save his fellow officers, and miraculously survives being shot 5 times. He returns to the force and the undercover team, driven to have the last word on the cowardly attacker.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Ernie Lijoi is an agent for the Quincy, MA police department, working in tandem with FBI and DEA. An informant tips him off that a crew of bank robbers are looking to sell $800,000 in stolen bonds.

    <desc lang="en">Nate Hutchinson is part of an undercover team in Ogden, UT while working for the Weber County Sheriff's Department. After years of undercover operations involving small time drug dealing, the team pays a call to an illegal pot grower. A seemingly routine call explodes when the grower ambushes and shoots five undercover agents, killing one. Hutchinson exhibits unbelievable acts of bravery to save his fellow officers, and miraculously survives being shot 5 times. He returns to the force and the undercover team, driven to have the last word on the cowardly attacker.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Nate Hutchinson is part of an undercover team in Ogden, UT while working for the Weber County Sheriff's Department. After years of undercover operations involving small time drug dealing, the team pays a call to an illegal pot grower. A seemingly routine call explodes when the grower ambushes and shoots five undercover agents, killing one. Hutchinson exhibits unbelievable acts of bravery to save his fellow officers, and miraculously survives being shot 5 times. He returns to the force and the undercover team, driven to have the last word on the cowardly attacker.</desc>
