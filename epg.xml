Gwen thinks that Tommy is just giving her a new outdoor kitchen as an anniversary gift but little does she know that Tommy has much more up his sleeve. During an anniversary party thrown for Tommy and Gwen, Tommy will surprise her by asking her to marry him all over again and renew their vows right there and then.

    <desc lang="en">RockyTop Log Furniture gets extra busy as their business expands to include building log homes.  Tommy's latest log home build is for new clients who lost everything in a fire. The site location is over two hours away and this causes friction back in the office. Gwen worries that a job so far from home will affect the business back at Rockytop and is less than thrilled with Tommy's decision to take on this project.  With such a tight turnaround Gwen wonders if they can continue to fill their log furniture orders on time and build this log home or will projects fall through the cracks. In addition to managing the company Gwen rounds up family and friends to shoot a music video for a song her nephew and niece wrote. Gwen's best friend choreographs an original line dance for the video but the group is having trouble getting the steps down. Gwen and Tommy work hard to pull off everything on their plate but it won't be easy.</desc>

They long for a log cabin of their own and turn to Tommy and Gwen for help. Tommy offers a solution! He can re-side the young couple's home with log siding. It will make the house warmer and give the couple the log cabin appearance they desire. Meanwhile the sales staff is in an uproar when they learn that the newest and youngest employee on staff got a new office chair! Many of the staff have been around since day one and using chairs that are at least 10 years old. The sales staff doesn't take this chair thing sitting down!</desc>
