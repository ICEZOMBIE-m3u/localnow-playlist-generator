    <desc lang="en">Aired 7/19/2020. Having met with the Ku Klux Klan in the first episode of United Shades five years ago, Kamau takes a deeper look into the damaging systemic applications of white supremacy in the United States. Through the lens of Pittsburgh and its local black leaders, writers and activists, Kamau investigates how this lauded progressive island masks a history of racism. Meeting with former leaders of the KKK and Nazis, as well as CNN correspondent Sara Sidner, Kamau examines the larger upwelling of national and international hate rhetoric in the current political era; an upwelling that led to the murder of eleven Jewish worshipers at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">For those who think that Ghosts and Spirits aren't real, this is a Ghost Investigation that will change their minds forever. The team from Haunted Events UK are called in to a 400 year old, three story, Victorian house on old High Street in Sutton Town, England - allegedly the most haunted area of Britain. Abandoned by the previous occupier due to alarming Poltergeist activity, the team enters the house to find it a wreck, strewn with objects scattered by the entities dwelling within its walls. Quickly, the team's medium is in touch with the Poltergeist who makes its presence known as a chair slides across the floor before their eyes, not once, but several times and on command. Unnerved but determined, the team moves around the house only to be bombarded by flying objects, lifting tables and two members of the team are even pushed to the floor. A never before filmed series of events occur, making this one of the most terrifying ghost hunts you will ever see. Witness flying objects, noises, thermal heat sources and experience strange forces working to warn the team to leave the residence by pushing over an investigator and leaving behind an actual thermal apparition.</desc>

    <desc lang="en"> Matt is out for revenge. Last year Dale beat him badly at the Annual Vintage bike race in Barber, Alabama. But this year there is a whole new tale to tell. With just days until the race - Dale is secretly struggling to get the bike he beat Matt with last year up and working. Matt struggles just to locate a 100-year old bike. Matt&amp;#39;s prayers are answered thanks to an old Catholic Priest he located who has possession of a bike. The priest might let Matt have the bike to race - but there are conditions. The toughest one: Don&amp;#39;t tell Dale you have it. Can Matt afford to buy the bike and get it running in time for the race without Dale seeing it? Will Dale even get his broken bike started? And if they ever get to race, will Matt exact his revenge?</desc>
