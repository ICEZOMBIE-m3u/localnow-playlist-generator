    <desc lang="en">Carter Oosterhouse takes us on a tour of three  luxurious Celebrity Motor Homes. Our tour of these incredible Celebrity Motor homes first takes us to Anaheim CA, to check out a coach used by WWE Super Star the Big show. Being one of the largest men in the world, it's very uncomfortable for the Big Show to travel by plane or car, so he took matters into his own gigantic hands and built this customized mobile man cave to fit his every need.   Then, our access into these amazing Celebrity Motor Homes continues as we take a tour of a luxury coach that hits all the right notes. Designer Molly Waggoner show us an ultra chic 43 foot trailer that she specifically customized for Christina Aguilera to use on set.  Our final stop on our tour of these incredible Celebrity Motor Homes now takes us to Nashville, Tennessee to catch up with 90's teen mega stars Hanson. We're rolling out the red carpet and giving you an exclusive look inside these amazing Celebrity Motor Homes.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Montgomery Gentry: First we go to Chesapeake, Virginia to meet up with country duo Montgomery Gentry before they go on stage. Eddie Montgomery and Troy Gentry give host, Drew Waters a tour of their two tricked out luxury buses. Eddie Montgomery first shows us around his bus, which is themed out to be a portable party on wheels. From Mardi Gras d�cor to a booming sound system, Eddie's bus was designed to entertain. With custom flooring, fully stocked bar and kitchen, a wine refrigerator, and a master suite with a walk in shower, it's no wonder that Eddie prefers to spend most of his time in his bus! Eddie even shares one of his favorite snacks with Drew when they both eat pickled eggs. Troy Gentry then gives Drew a tour of his bus, which has been decked out to feel like a bat cave where Troy and his team can get business done as well as relax. Troy shows off his redesigned kitchen where he and his wife can cook some down home country meals no matter where they are. His bus also features rustic dark wood floors and master suite with a walk in shower that features bench seating. Jeff Dunham: Then we're off to Billings, Montana where Drew meets up with ventriloquist comedian, Jeff Dunham before he performs in front of a sold out crowd. Jeff and his wife Audrey give Drew the tour of their home away from home. As the highest paid ventriloquist in the world, Jeff has been able to customize his luxury tour bus to meet his every need. Jeff's bus features a modern style that runs throughout a living room, kitchen, dining area, bunks, dog kennel, work out space and writing room, but the main attraction on this top of the line tour bus is a fully customized puppet work shop where Jeff can create, maintain and repair all of his co-stars. Jeff surprises Drew with a guest appearance from his hilarious puppet, Walter.Rodney Atkins: Last we head to Nashville, Tennessee where country sensation Rodney Atkins gives us a tour of his luxury liner. Rodney's tour bus features a French country themed living room, extra large kitchen with enough room to clean a deer and a master suite where he can kick off his boots and get some shut-eye. Rodney also introduces us to two things he never leaves home with out. The first is his best friend, a parrot named Misty that makes some unusual noises. Then Rodney lets us check out his pride a joy, a motorcycle that he uses to drive around the cities he visits while on tour.</desc>

    <desc lang="en">Aired 11/22/2020. On November 22nd, 1963 the assassination of President John F. Kennedy launched the presidency of Lyndon Baines Johnson – and catapulted his wife Lady Bird into a role that she didn’t prepare for. The Johnson administration enacted one of the most prolific legislative programs in U.S. history – but it likely wouldn’t have succeeded without Lady Bird Johnson’s steadying presence. Lady Bird became a master mediator, helping to soothe discord in the administration, and shape LBJ’s reputation in the country.</desc>

In 2008, Michelle Obama became the first African American first lady after her husband, Barack Obama, was elected as the first African American President of the United States. Michelle and Barack were elected on a wave of euphoria, but not everyone shared in the enthusiasm of the moment and they endured vicious attacks. In spite of this, Michelle’s popularity climbed, and she became a critical factor in President Obama’s re-election in 2012. During her time in the White House, Michelle used her platform to speak on issues such as gun violence and launched the Let’s Move! initiative dedicated to combating childhood obesity.</desc>

As always the adventure will end with a feast, right back in Chintan’s kitchen.</desc>
